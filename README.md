## Match Tracker

Just a hobby project that lets users track football matches that they have went to and share their experiences with others.

### Environments
The project uses Vercel for hosting and has the following environments:
- Test: [https://match-tracker-git-test-espenkalvatns-projects.vercel.app](https://match-tracker-git-test-espenkalvatns-projects.vercel.app)
- Production: [https://matchtracker.vercel.app](https://matchtracker.vercel.app/)

In addition to these environments, Vercel also creates a preview environment for each pull request. The test environment is working as a shadow environment for the production environment, but with another database.
